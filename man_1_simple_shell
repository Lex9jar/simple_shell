through a terminal emulator and some executable instructions(shell scripts) the user can interact with this \fBsimple_shell.\fR
This simple_shell is not supossed to be an exact imitation of the original Unix Shell. This doesn't cover all of the instructions the original does.

.br
.\&
.RS
\&> ./hsh

The prompt '#cisfun$ ' will appear on terminal. You could enter commands following the prompt. You can't handle multiple commands using ';' '&&' '||' specifiers. Once you have entered the commands you execute the commands finishing by pressing 'ENTER' key.


.SH FEATURES

* This program displays a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line (when user push ENTER key).

* The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.

* When the user enters exit, Hell shell will end and returns the status 0.

* When the user enters exit [status], Hell Shell will end and return the inputed status, where status is a value from 0 to 255.

* The user could stop the program using Ctrl+D (end of file).

* The shell handles command lines with arguments and pathways.

* The program does not quit when the user inputs ^C (Ctrl+C).

* This program executes the most common shell commands as ls, grep, find, pwd, rm, cp, mv, exit, env, history, etc... with arguments.
